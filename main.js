/* 
INTRO:

You are given a string cipher (an encoded message). This string will have a random assortment of characters
but using a key (the array that is past through), you will dycript the cipher and reveal the message! 
The message should be returned from the function as a string. 



Example:
string = "HdMdLeludblfgOo"
key = [ 5, 0, 6, 10, 14 ]
message = "Hello"

Hint: The key needs to be in ascending order to work.

//ðŸ‘‰ Use the function below!:

export default function decryptMessage(cipher, scrambledKey) {
  return message;
}
